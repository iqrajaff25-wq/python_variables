#Assignment # 03
#  Battery Health Analyzer
#  Objective: To analyze phone battery status based on percentage and charging condition.

#  Requirements:
#  1. Ask the user for current battery percentage (0–100) and whether the phone is charging
#  (yes/no).
#  2. Use only if-else, logical, and comparison operators to print the correct message.
#  Formula:
#  Logical conditions used for decision making (e.g., If (Battery ≤ 10) and (Charging == 'no')).
#  Conditions:- Battery ≤ 10 and not charging →  Battery Critical – Plug in immediately!- 
#  Battery ≤ 10 and charging →  Charging started just in time!-
#  10 < Battery ≤ 30 and not charging → Battery Low – Consider charging soon. 
#  30 < Battery ≤ 60 and not charging →  Battery OK – Moderate usage allowed.
#  60 < Battery ≤ 90 and charging →  Battery good – you can unplug soon. 
#  Battery > 90 and charging →  Battery Full – Unplug charger to save energy. 
#  Otherwise →  Battery sufficient – all good!
